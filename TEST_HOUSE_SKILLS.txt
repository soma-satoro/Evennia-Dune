NOTES FOR STAFF
===============

1. Skills should align with domains:
   - Military domain → High Battle
   - Political domain → High Communicate
   - Science domain → High Understand
   - Espionage domain → High Move
   - Religion domain → High Discipline

2. Total skill points by House type:
   - Great House: 35 (9+8+7+6+5)

   - Minor House: 28 (7+6+6+5+4)
