Status: 65/100
Reputation: Problematic (magenta)
Effects: Aggressive: -2 Diff | Diplomatic: +1 Diff | +1 Threat

aggressively but diplomacy suffers. Other Houses plotting.

## Dangerous Minor House (Status 80)

# Now at 80, Dangerous (renamed to Threat)

VIEW: +house Threat

EXPECTED DISPLAY:
Status: 80/100
Reputation: Dangerous (bright red)
Effects: Actions: -2 Diff | Diplomatic: +2 Diff | +1 Threat per action

NARRATIVE: House Threat is dangerously powerful for a Minor House. Possibly 
making play for Major House status. Active opposition from peers. Powerful 
but isolated.


EXAMPLE: Different House Types at Same Status
==============================================

Create three Houses, all at status 50:

+house/create Minor50=House Minor
+house/create Major50=House Major
+house/create Great50=Great House

+house/status Minor50/set=50
+house/status Major50/set=50
+house/status Great50/set=50

COMPARE REPUTATIONS:

Minor50:  Status 50/100 - Strong (41-50 range)
Major50:  Status 50/100 - Respected (41-60 range)
Great50:  Status 50/100 - Weak (41-60 range for Great is Weak!)

INSIGHT: The same status value means different things for different House types.
A Minor House at 50 is doing very well. A Major House at 50 is normal. A Great 
House at 50 has suffered major losses and is weakened.
